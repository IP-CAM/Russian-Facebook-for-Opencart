# Pre-requisites prior to installing the plugin
  1. The plugin supports these OpenCart versions - 2.0.1.1, 2.0.2.0, 2.0.3.1, 2.1.0.1, 2.1.0.2, 2.2.0.0, 2.3.0.0, 2.3.0.1, 2.3.0.2, 3.0.2.0 and 3.0.3.1.

  2. Remove all existing pixel implementations from the website. Duplicate pixel events may be fired if there are existing pixel implementations.

  3. Installation of the plugin is via OCMOD.
      - For OpenCart 2.x, you need to either:
        - Option 1: Enable FTP option. [Screenshot](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TuxkIjoZgj2f3tK0ZnX1LSqlJfsEdTN_)
          - Go to the admin panel of OpenCart and click on Menu -> Settings.
          - Click on Edit button of your store.
          - Click on FTP tab and setup the FTP details.
        - Option 2: Install QuickFix: Extensions Installer issue when FTP support disabled. 
          - [Download Link](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=18892)
      - For Opencart 3.x, there is no additional setup required to use OCMOD.
      - VQMOD installation is NOT supported.

  4. Give read+write+execute permissions to the admin, catalog and system folders and their child folders on your OpenCart web server. Our plugin will need these permissions to copy over some new files to your web server. [Screenshot](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1igyGa2mWpdjPylhiRuiD4hmK20oCAEGC)

  5. For Opencart 3.x, you need to disable the theme cache, as we are making modifications to the header.twig file. [Screenshot](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bY-bworYxX36b88HDvFW0_32C3Wtq_Tm)
      - Go to the admin panel of OpenCart and click on Menu -> Dashboard.
      - Click on the Settings button on the top right.
      - Click on Off option for Theme and click on the Refresh button.

  6. Download the latest version of the plugin file, facebook_ads_extension.ocmod.zip.
      - You can get the latest version of the plugin from these websites:
        - [OpenCart marketplace](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=32336)
        - [Github latest release](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Facebook-For-OpenCart/releases/latest)

      - Ensure that the plugin file ends with .ocmod.zip extension. [Screenshot](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19hCCtDKLY12uiKu4WOJ_KGv_5_PNlS7m)

  7. Ensure that the OpenCart database user has the permission rights to CREATE_TABLE, ALTER_TABLE, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE. Our plugin requires these permissions to create a new database table to link the association of the OpenCart products with Facebook products and store the settings of the Facebook Business Extension.

  8. Our plugin is designed based on the default OpenCart folder structure as admin, catalog and system. If your folder structure is not the same, you will need to modify the plugin yourself to make it compatible with your folder structure. The changes will include:
      - changing the folder names of the plugin.
      - Updating the method getRequiredFiles() in the admin/controller/extension/facebookadsextension.php file.
      - Updating the method getRequiredFiles() in the catalog/controller/extension/facebookeventparameters.php file.
      - Updating the install.xml file with references on admin, catalog and system.

  9. Our plugin will create the catalog feed of all your products to be uploaded to Facebook after completing the setup for Facebook pixel and catalog. Depending on your web server and database server configurations, you may experience issues with your database server if you have a large product catalog, eg more than 5000 products. You may need to increase the memory settings for your webserver and database server. Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Facebook-For-OpenCart/blob/master/FAQ.md) for more details.
